# Requirements for Software Security Engineering

???
We now start examining phases in the software development lifecycle where security engineering activities are most relevant. We start "early" in the lifecycle with Requirements. This is an important lifecycle phase to develop the problem context for the engineering activities. This phase also requires a lot of interactions with the system stakeholders to make sure that software meets operational intent.

In interactions with real customers, you will quickly realize that requirements are not just out there for the taking. You have to elicit requirements. Which means that a good requirements engineer needs to draw them out from the customer by asking the right questions using a structured method.

NIST SP 800-160, the systems security engineering guide, identifies two technical processes in the requirements lifecycle phase where security can be integrated. The first process is the Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition Process.
The purpose of this process from a security perspective is to define the stakeholder security requirements] that include [protection capability](https://robinagandhi.github.io/swa/slides/lecture-1/systems-security-engineering.html#16), security characteristics, and security-driven constraints for the systems. The goal of this activity is to securely provide the capabilities needed by users and other stakeholders in a defined operational environment. Like the previous sentence in the definition, the we want to identify capabilities including general features and security features.

The second technical process in the requirements lifecycle phase is to the System Requirements Definition Process. Now you might be a little surprised here. Did we not just talk about his? Actually, no! The goal of this process is to transform the stakeholder security requirements and needs into the system requirements]. The previous process resulted in requirements that reflect needs in the operational environment. This process results in requirements that reflect a .red[technical security view] of the system. More specifically, the outcomes of this process are a list of active protection capabilities needed in the software to support the stakeholder needs. Depending on the threats perceived in the operational environment we also determine what is the adequate assurance and strength of the protection capability that is needed. This analysis translates into passive protection capabilities for software construction and operation.

## .red[Stakeholder Needs and   
Requirements] vs .blue[System Requirements]

> Litmus test for requirements:  
_Would the stakeholders still have the requirement even if we did not build the software?_
- **Yes:** It is a stakeholder requirement and need. These are located in the [environment of operation for the system-of-interest](https://robinagandhi.github.io/swa/slides/lecture-1/systems-security-engineering.html#13)
- **No:** It is a system/software requirements. These are located at the shared interface between the machine and the environment

.top-right[
![litmus-test](https://sciencenotes.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Litmus-Test.png)

???
As it often turns out, the two processes and the resulting requirements are not distinguished in practice. This leads to a lot of issues, in particular with the early conceptualization of security needs and the corresponding balance of protection capabilities to be engineered for the system. These decisions get pushed until later in the software lifecycle. So how do we tell apart the among the two types of requirements? I have a quick litmus test for you. Here, the question to ask for each requirement is as follows: "Would the stakeholders still have the requirement even if we did not build the software?"

The system requirements or machine behavior are at the shared interface with the environment and the given conditions in the environment connect the two.

# Need üëâüèº Fitness for Purpose
## Software is built for a purpose
- It will fail if either:  
1. Designer has inadequate understanding of the purpose  
1. Software is used for a purpose different than originally designed for  

## Inadequate understanding of the purpose leads to poor quality software

???
This understanding now helps us realize that stakeholder needs determine a given software's fitness for purpose. Software is built for a purpose. So, software will fail if we have an inadequate understanding of it purpose, or the software is used for a purpose different that it is originally designed for. Now, either one of these scenarios can be true for open-source software that you have selected for your semester projects.

Inadequate understanding of the purpose can occur due to several reasons.
1. The software is too complex i.e. designer does not know for sure if software will fulfill it purpose
1. The designer does not have the knowledge or experience
1. The customer does not clearly know the purpose or express it or the purpose becomes apparent later in the system lifecycle
1. Or there could be a deliberate attempt to make the software not fulfill its purpose

To avoid these problems, software engineers often use structured methods to understand a systems purpose. Let's look at two popular methods. I will point out that developers often use these methods incorrectly. They focus primarily on the system requirements and much less to understand the purpose of system, i.e the stakeholder requirements and needs.

Use cases were made popular by UML and its use of object-oriented programming to build complex software systems.

Use cases capture why and how would someone use software? The why question comes before the how. So they follow a goal-driven scenario elicitation technique.

User needs (goals) are fulfilled by descriptions of system behavior (Scenarios)

The purpose of use case is to build system requirements that fulfill user needs. They their structure promotes a consistent prose, motivates the identification of multiple scenarios per use case and the description is often tabular, a semi-formal way to express requirements.

User stories are more popular with agile processes. But we can see that they are also goal-driven scenario elicitation techniques.

User stories are started on 2 x 4 index cards. So their specification is a bit informal compared to use cases, but often elaborated using test-driven methodology. i.e. for each scenario a series of tests are specified for the system.

The three c's of user stories are cards, conversation and confirmation.


The conversation is typically verbal to discuss the expectations around the card.
Finally, the Confirmation is the acceptance test.

Here is an example of a user story card. It follows a restricted natural language pattern that starts with the user role, then the wants of that user in terms of system interaction, followed by the reason for the interaction.

With these structured techniques, you can start to realize that understanding the problem context needs engineering know-how. This engineering know-how is pursued by the field of Requirements engineering. In the next video we will discuss more about requirement engineering and understand the primary theory of security requirements elicitation using a special notation called problem frames.

# [What is Requirements Engineering?](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sme/RE01/)

.footnote[
See notes (hit `p`) for definition
]

???
Requirements engineering has a long standing professional international conference. Many prominent researchers in software engineering helped get it started. So it is worth while to read their description from the very first conference to see what requirements engineering is all about.

According to the website:
> Requirements Engineering (RE) lies at the heart of software development.  

> RE is concerned with identifying the purpose of a software system, and the contexts in which it will be used.  

> Hence, RE acts as the bridge between the real world needs of users, customers, and other constituencies affected by a software system, and the capabilities and opportunities afforded by software-intensive technologies.

Source: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sme/RE01/

In short, its purpose is to build a bridge between the two types of requirements we discussed in the last video.

# Stakeholder Needs and Requirements

## These requirements are about .red[relationships] in the environment of operation
- They are not about the software system
- They are not about the shared interface at the environment of operation and the software system
- They are effects in the environment of operation that the customer wants the software system to guarantee

.top-right[
![Requirements](images/requirements.png)
]

???
In this video we start to put structure around the requirements elicitation activity by identifying the ways in which we express them. We know from before that stakeholder needs and requirements are about relationships in the environment of operation. They are not about the software system and they are also not about the shared interface at the environment of operation and the software system. They are effects in the environment of operation that the customer wants the software system to guarantee.

# Stakeholder Needs and Requirements

## Expressed in two moods
- .red[Optative]: expresses a wish (R)   
Desired condition over the phenomena of the environment
- .red[Indicative]: expresses things existing in the problem world (D)   
Given properties of the environment of operation

???
As a result these requirements are typically expressed as wish over the phenomena of the operational environment. If you remember, the litmus test, then you know that stakeholder requirements exist whether we build the system or not. So this makes sense. In addition to stakeholder wishes, we also have to collect information about the operational environment. These properties are generally expressed in an indicative mood, i.e. they express things that existing in the problem world.

Let's call the first set of requirements expressed in the optative mood as (R) and the indicative mood as (D)

---
class: middle
# System Requirements

## Expressed in a single mood
- .red[Optative]: expresses a wish, Specification (S)  
Desired condition over the shared phenomena at the interface between the system and the environment of operation

???
Compared to the stakeholder needs and requirements, the system requirements are only expressed in an optative mood. They express a wish which reflects the desired condition over the shared phenomena at the interface between the system and the environment of operation. We call this set of requirement as (S). The letter S also comes from the fact that these system requirements are often referred to as the Specification.

While brainstorming stakeholder or system requirements, we have to be aware of the tendency to start describing the solution context and lose focus of the problem context. So to stay focused on the problem context, and to really understand R, D and S, we need a better notation. One such notation is Problem frames.

---

class: middle
# Problem Frames
Allows focus on `problems` to be solved.

???
Problem frames is a notation specifically designed for requirements engineers to focus on the problems to be solved. While we will use a different notation for our semester project security requirements, the study of problem frames will help us understand the foundational theory behind security requirements.

.right-column[

???
The diagraming typically starts with the machine to be developed. This is a rectangle with two stripes.

Next, you identify any designed domains, i.e. man-made artifacts that will need to exist in environment of operation. These are represented using rectangles with a single stripe. Finally, things that already exist in the environment are called given domains. They are represented as a rectangle with no stripes.  

Finally, dashed ovals represent requirements. They are dashed because they are conceptual and not tangible entities like the designed and given domains or the machine.

![legend](images/legend.svg)
]

???
The rectangles and ovals are connected with a solid or dashed line. Dashed lines can also have an arrow.

The solid line represents shared phenomena or an interface between the domains and the machine. For example, an input or output would take place through an interface.

A dashed line relates a domain to a requirement to indicate a requirement reference.

When this reference include an arrow, it means that the requirement constraints the domain to behave in a certain way or constraints its intrinsic properties. Hence it is called a constraining reference.

# A Basic Problem Frame

![legend](images/problem-frame.svg)
???
So let's put this all together in the most basic form of a problem frame diagram. Here we have a machine that interacts with a given domain in the environment of operation. The requirement adds a constraint to the intrinsic properties or behavior of the given domain.

# Problem Frame Example

- A PC user wants to analyze the messages in the   
mail client‚Äôs mailbox.
- The messages for each correspondent are concatenated  
in one file. The mailfiles are all in one directory
- The analysis report has a specified format, with   
detail lines in order by correspondent name
- The analysis report will also show statistics on volume, size   
and frequency of incoming messages, time taken to reply

???
What better way to learn problem frames, than to apply it to study a given problem.

Here we have a PC user who want to analyze messages in the mail client's mailbox. There seems to a certain structure to the mail files and they are all in a single directory. The report expected by the user also has some available guidance.

Pause the video here and try to construct a problem frame diagram based on this description. Go ahead and pause, I really mean it!

# Context Diagram

.footnote[
Recap: Requirements are about .red[relationships] in the environment of operation
]

???
Here is how I would construct the problem frame diagram. The machine we want to build is the mailbox analyzer. The mailfiles are a given domain. They exist in the environment of operation. The analysis report is what we want to produce as an output artifact, so it is a designed domain. The format of the analysis report is constrained by the requirement of the analysis rules specified in the description. With this diagram it is now easy to see that requirements are about relationships in the environment of operation.

In this diagram you also see annotations for the relationships. Let's look at what they mean.

---
class: middle
# Relationships
.left-column[

.code[a: MF! {MsgDir, File, Char}]  

Domain .code[MF] initiates observable phenomena .code[MsgDir, File, Char] on interface .code[a]
]
.right-column[
![example](images/example.svg)
]

???
let's look at annotation a. This specification suggests that on shared interface a, the Mail File or the MF domain initiates an event. We know this because this domain name has an exclamation mark next to it. This event generated by the MF domain includes observable items such as the MsgDir, File name and Characters as input to the Machine.

Similarly, for b, the machine initiates an observable event that adds certain items to the Analysis Report domain.

c and d annotations represent the specific items that are part of the requirements reference with respect to the domains.

# Frame Components

### .red[R: Requirements]  
What the customer wants to be true in terms of (c, d)

### .red[D: Domain Properties]

### .red[S: Specification]  
How we want the machine to behave at interface (a, b)  
]

.right-column[
![example](images/example.svg)
]
???
So what makes this frame diagram special? Let me elaborate.
In this diagram we now distinctly see the Stakeholder requirements, which includes the R and D. R is specified in the optative mood about what the customer wants to be true in terms of the references to the domains.
D is what we know to be true in the domain. D is specified in the indicative mood. Both R and D combined together form the stakeholder needs and requirements.

S specifies the system requirements. It conveys how we want the machine to behave in its interaction with the given and designed domains in the environment of operation. In other words, a and b are the shared phenomena at the interface between the system and the environment of operation.

# Correctness argument

- The argument to make:  
_(R)equirements_, _(S)pecifications_ and _(D)omain descriptions_ .red[fit] together

???
So to make sure that the machine will meet the operational intent, i.e. we build the right solution, we have to satisfy the following correctness argument. S entails D, R. i.e. They all fit together.

---
# Correctness argument
## Creating (R) is not enough !!
- Creating descriptions of the environment (D) and specification (S) helps our comprehension and provides basis for .red[validating] the requirements

???
Now we know that creating just R is not enough. To build a bridge from stakeholder needs (R) to the system specification (S), we also need to create descriptions of the environment (D).

--

## Claim: R is fulfilled
- Unless D or S is Insufficient
- Unless D or S is Incorrect
--

- Unless D or S is .red[Malicious]

???
So a claim that R is fulfilled can be defeated with a rebuttal that the given D or S is Insufficient, Incorrect or in the case of security engineering, D or S is Malicious. That is, Threat agents exist in the operational environment (D) or the machine specification (S) allows malicious behaviors.
---
class: middle
# Fitness for Purpose: S &#x2192; D, R

## Under constrained behavior
- (S, D) lacks constraints to fulfill (R)  
E.g.: Buffer overflows, Unauthorized physical/network access

--

## Over constrained behavior
- (S, D) includes constraints such that (R) CANNOT be fulfilled  
E.g: 8 char password only, No access allowed

???
Therefore to make an argument that a machine is fit for purpose, the engineering effort needs to show that machine or the domain descriptions are not under or over specified which result in unwanted behaviors.

---

# Problem Frames
![annotated](images/example-annotated.png)
???
With a frame diagram, we can now reason about missing domain descriptions or system specifications from a security engineering perspective. More importantly, we can pin point the source of issues with poor conceptualization of security requirements. For example missing a domain description of a malicious actor in the environment of operation OR perhaps a missing system specification that allows exploitable weaknesses in the developed system OR even missing security needs from the stakeholder!

# How to systematically reason about these issues?
- Solution: Abuse frames

]

???
Now that we are comfortable reading Frame diagrams, let's use them to understand the fundamental approach to identifying and refining security requirements. This approach leads to a systematic elicitation of security requirements initiated by domain descriptions of malicious (or in some cases clumsy) agents in the environment of operation.

This approach is described in a 2003 technical report, which calls these problem frame diagrams for security requirements elaboration as Abuse Frames.

# Abuse Frame
![af](images/abuse-frame.png)

## Abuse argument
- For an attacker (AT), the specification of the Malicious Machine (MM) satisfies the anti-requirement (AR)


???
The fundamental pattern, useful for security requirements elicitation is show in this problem frame or aptly named Abuse frame. Here the problem world is analyzed from the perspective of an Attacker. The attacker exists as a given domain in the environment of operation. The attacker wants to fulfill an anti-requirement to harm a given Asset domain. Now take note that the anti-requirement is a negative requirement from the perspective of the attacker. The Malicious Machine or MM can be the machine that is being built, or could be another machine that is used specifically by the attacker (e.g. a virus or a scanner) that is not originally part of the problem world (D).

Given this frame, the Abuse argument makes the case that for an attacker (AT), the specification of the Malicious Machine (MM) allows observable effects on the asset domain (AS) to satisfy the anti-requirement (AR).

This fundamental pattern, known as the abuse frame is the genesis of security requirements engineering process. Let's apply it to the mailfile problem world.

Some examples and definitions:

> Example 1:
M/M: Wireshark
AS: Network messages
AT: Rouge ISP
AR: Targeted Advertising

>Example 2:
M/M: FBI Website with SQL injection vulnerability  
AS: Identity Database
AT: Lulzsec
AR: Threaten FBI Agents through identity theft


>Malicious Machine (M/M)
Can be assigned to an existing domain, or a domain that is introduced into the problem world in order to reflect that an attacker can utilize the existing domains or other tools (e.g., a virus) that are not originally in the problem world D.

>Vulnerability v(D)
Conditions in the problem world that combined with the Malicious Machine specification, will satisfy the anti-requirements

???
Here we see that the malicious machine domain is assigned to existing domain of the mailfile analyzer machine, but with a weakness in its specification. The weakness is that of not having any authentication. Such a machine allows the analysis report asset to be read, leading to the satisfaction of the anti-requirement of the malicious user in the problem world.

# Security Problem Frame
![spf](images/security-problem-frame.png)

## Correctness argument
- For an attacker (AT), the specification of the Security Machine (SM) satisfies the security requirement (SR)  

???
Establishing an abuse argument, allows a security requirements engineer to specify a security frame. The security frame is also specified from the perspective of an attacker in the environment of operation. But in this frame, a "security machine" domain is specified that prevents harm to the asset by satisfying the security requirement (SR). The Security Machine or SM can be the machine that is being built, or could be another machine that is built specifically stop the attacker (e.g. an authentication module). The security machine represents active protection mechanisms. Which means that this kind of protection mechanism adds code to the software or system being built.

Given this frame, the correctness argument makes the case that for an attacker (AT), the specification of the Security Machine (SM) allows observable effects on the asset domain (AS) to satisfy the security requirement (SR).

# Security Frame (mailfile example)
![sfmailfile](images/example-sf.png)

???
Applying the security frame pattern to counter the abuse frame for the mailfile example could result in a security frame as shown. Here we have introduced a Customer identifier security machine that satisfies the security requirement to identify and authorize the customer. We have also introduced a designed domain of an authentication database that allows the result domain to reflect the status of the identify of the Customer domain. Since it is a designed domain and not a given domain, it has a single stripe in its notation. Machine domains have two stripes.

???
Examining the abuse frame and the corresponding security frame next to each other demonstrates a systematic reasoning method to identify protection mechanisms needed in response to the attacks perceived in the environment of operation.

This approach aligns well with our definition of software assurance, which took an attack based approach to undertake engineering activities in the system development lifecycle. That is exactly what we did here.

But we are not done. This is just the first step. As security professionals, we should anticipate a malicious and intelligent attackers will improvise in response to protection mechanisms. So a couple more rounds of analysis should be carried out at this early stage in the requirements lifecycle.

The next round or analysis starts where we left off. It starts with the identification of an abuse frame that would allow the fulfillment of an anti-requirement despite the presence of the protection mechanism.

class: middle
# Iterative Process
## Another Abuse Frame
![abuse](images/example-af-3.png)

For the mailbox analyzer example, the attacker can use a SQL injection weakness to bypass the authentication protection mechanism. This attack satisfies the attacker's anti-requirement of allowing fake customer authorization. Here MU is short for Malicious User.

---
class: middle
# Iterative Process
## Counter with another Security Frame
![secure](images/example-sf-2.png)

???
Now the security engineer responds with another security frame, that introduces the need for an input validator security machine that satisfies the security requirement of stoping injection attacks that can change the authentication result.

Again, the analysis does not need to stop here. The attacker can improvise again.

---

class: middle
# Iterative Process
## Yet another Abuse Frame!
![abuse](images/example-af.png)

???
In this abuse frame, an assumption is made about the presence of a Trojan backdoor in the Mail Analyzer machine.

At this point, the security engineer can make a decision that this abuse frame is out of scope for the engineering effort. If it is not out of scope, then the engineer can ask for passive protection mechanisms such as configuration management and code review in the construction of the mailbox analyzer. These passive protection mechanisms do not add code to the mailbox analyzer, but provides a reliable environment for the construction of the mailbox analyzer. These protection mechanisms can be implemented as constraints on the problem domain (D).

Here we can observe that a security frame can suggest both active and passive protection mechanisms through successive refinement of security requirements driven by abuse frames.

# The Design Problem

## What security functions/capabilities are needed in the software, i.e. Specification (S), such that given (D), (R) is satisfiable?  
- Security functions  
  Security Functional Requirements - Active Protections

## What weaknesses should be avoided in the software, i.e. Specification (S), such that given (D), (R) is satisfiable?  
- No exploitable weaknesses  
  Assurance and Strength requirements - Passive Protections

???
The iterative analysis should demonstrate to you that providing _adequate security_ in a system is a design problem. Stated more formally using the concepts that we learned from problem frames, the design problem is two fold: First, what security function or capabilities exist in software, that is the specification (S), such that given the presence of a malicious user in the operational environment (D), the requirements, including security requirements are satisfied.
Second, what weakness should be avoided in software, that is the specification (S), and given conditions in the operational environment (D), the requirements, are satisfied.

## Security functions in the specification (S)   
E.g. Encryption module, access control
## Security constraints on the problem world (D)  
E.g. Controlled physical access, access logs, cleared user base, authorization db

???
As additional examples of this design work, we can see that active protection mechanisms can be implemented as part of the software specification or as additional mechanisms in the operational world, as part of (D).

For example, encryption is typically part of the software specification, but phyical access mechanism such as cared entry can be implemented outside the software and in the problem world.

---
class: middle
# .green[Passive] Protection Security Requirements  

## Weaknesses avoided in security functions of the specification (S)

E.g. password sticky notes, guessable passwords, ad-hoc authorizations, poor clearance processes

Similarly, passive protection mechanisms can be applied to develop a system that minimizes weaknesses, or enforce constraints in the problem domain that minimize weaknesses in the problem domain. For example, coding standards and language frameworks can eliminate several weaknesses in the software, and at the same time enforcement of policies and user training can avoid weaknesses in the problem world where the software will be used.

# Reflection

## What did we just do?
- Using problem frames we built a bridge from stakeholder requirements to system requirements by identifying the necessary causal chains in the problem world.
- Using abuse and security frames we identify the causal chains and .green[security capabilities and assurances necessary in software] to satisfy the .blue[security requirements of the stakeholder.]

In summary, the discussion on problem frames created the right abstractions for an engineering approach to be applied. We built a bridge from the stakeholder requirements to system requirements by introducing an attacker in the problem world. In particular, we demonstrated the use of abuse and security frames to reveal the causal chains necessary for security requirements to be satisfied.

Now I realize that software developers today do not use problem frames. In the next video, we will talk about requirement engineering methods that will allow us to apply what we learned here in modern software development processes. The fundamental philosophy of using an attackers perspective to refine security requirements remains the same regardless of the specific notation or method being used.
