# How to Clone this Repo

Use these instructions if you do not intend to contribute any upstream changes. In a CLI navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Then run the following clone command:

```bash
# Make a empty directory and switch to it
mkdir swa
cd swa
# Clone the Repository to the current directory
# Notice the `.` at the end of the command
git clone https://www.github.com/robinagandhi/swa .
```
Now examine the ```swa``` directory structure. It should have the same directory structure as this repository on Github.com.

The master branch includes the following content:
* `master`: This branch includes files for course planning, project description, course syllabus, markdown based slides and any self-paced tutorials for class lectures.

To keep your local repository updated with upstream changes use the git pull command.
```bash
# update the repository
git pull
```
