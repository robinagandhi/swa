# Syllabus - Fall 2025

# Course Description
* Assurance is a reasoned, audit-able argument created to support claimed beliefs about an entity – Generally, the entity is so complex that it is not possible (i.e. time, technology, or resources are constrained) to examine every possible circumstance related to the claimed beliefs.
* This course is an intersection of knowledge areas necessary to perform activities relevant for promoting assurance through claims argued and supported with evidence from `Software Security Engineering (SSE)` activities. Software Assurance entails SSE. We will practice with tools and techniques that guide human reasoning and trust decisions, which, while being process agnostic, can be integrated into various software development lifecycle approaches, including vibe coding, DevOps, DevSecOps, and more traditional waterfall and spiral models. 
* This course takes on a software development lifecycle perspective for the prevention of flaws. It is not just secure coding!

# Class Format
* **Asynchronous** fully-online lectures, assignments, and exams
* **Synchronous** weekly team meetings at team determined times. Bi-weekly instructor check-ins will be required before the submission of major assignments. Multiple time-slots will be available to teams for flexibility in scheduling instructor check-ins.

# Engagement
While course content can be passively consumed, active participation in various class activities is important for your learning success. Here are some dimensions of [engagement](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/00346543074001059):

1. **Behavioral engagement**: attend and participate in class activities and discussions; follow class norms; study class materials and timely completion of assignments.
1. **Cognitive engagement**: desire a challenge; plan, monitor and evaluate one's thinking and learning (reflection).
2. **Emotional engagement**: comfortable talking to peers; engage in group learning where appropriate; ask questions about course material; interested, inquisitive and curious about academic content.

# Policy on Plagiarism

It is a violation of the academic integrity policy to misrepresent work that you submit or exchange with your instructor by characterizing it as your own. Submitting responses to assignments that do not acknowledge the use of entities like generative AI tools, another person’s work or your own work in another course without proper acknowledgment of the source will be considered plagiarism.

You will have the opportunity to defend yourself if you are suspected of submitting a plagiarized assignment. Cheating, fabrication and falsification, plagiarism or complicity in academic dishonesty will not be tolerated in this class. Copying text from public sources (websites, blogs, and books) or have someone else write for you (including Generative AI) will be considered plagiarism if such sentences are not adequately acknowledged or referenced. Please feel free to contact me with any questions about using generative AI tools before submitting any content that has been substantially informed by these tools. Students shall give credit to AI tools whenever used, even if only to generate ideas rather than usable text, diagrams or illustrations.

A full listing of violations of the academic integrity policy can be found here:
[http://www.unomaha.edu/student-life/student-conduct-and-community-standards/policies/academic-integrity.php](http://www.unomaha.edu/student-life/student-conduct-and-community-standards/policies/academic-integrity.php)

Any incidents of academic dishonesty will be handled according to the UNO academic integrity procedures. Make yourself familiar with writing techniques such that you can cite external sources or summarize them without plagiarizing. Here are some resources to get you started:

- Guidance for Quoting, Paraphrasing and Summarizing:
[https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/using_research/quoting_paraphrasing_and_summarizing/index.html](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/using_research/quoting_paraphrasing_and_summarizing/index.html)

- How to cite Chat-GPT
[https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt](https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt)

Many of your class deliverables will be on Github in a public repository. As a result, you must be extra careful to avoid plagiarism through responsible and ethical practices.

# Exams
There will be a mid-term and a final exam. The exams will consist of essay-type questions which may require design and modeling activities. These exams will allow full access to technology and are intended to help focus on the essential parts of the course material, reinforce learning, and provide timely feedback. The exam questions will typically have multiple parts, be sure you answer all the parts.

# Team Working Sessions
Synchronous working sessions for teams will correspond to the stages of the software development lifecycle. The objective of these sessions is to gain hands-on experience with various techniques and tools for software assurance and apply them to understand the engineering activities necessary for building security in. Details about these sessions will follow as we go further into the semester.

# Team-based Semester Project
We will examine this aspect of the course in more detail on the [Team Project Page](https://robinagandhi.github.io/swa/pages/project.html).

# Grading
20% Mid-term  
20% Final exam (Comprehensive)  
20% Quizzes, Discussions, and Class participation  
40% Team-based Semester Project Deliverables

# Course Schedule
On Canvas I have a weekly schedule for the course that will help you plan ahead.

Due to the current and advanced nature of this class, it is under constant revision! Expect shuffling of course topics as we progress through the semester. Constructive feedback on the content is highly encouraged. Fork it on Github!

# Supplies
* To support class activities and access course materials, a laptop or desktop computer with a webcam and mic is required.
* A notebook, and pencil. It helps to first scribble your ideas on paper and then tranfer them into an electronic medium for sharing. We will be doing a lot of drawing!

# Important Dates
[See Canvas](https://unomaha.instructure.com/login)

# Emails
All email sent to me regarding the class must have the class descriptor and your name in the subject field, e.g. (8420 - TOPIC). We will be using Canvas for all course assignment submissions and exams.
