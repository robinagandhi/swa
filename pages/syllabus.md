# Syllabus

# Course Description
* Assurance is a reasoned, audit-able argument created to support claimed beliefs about a particular entity *when it is not possible (i.e. time, technology, or resources are constrained) to examine every possible circumstance related to that claim*.
* This course is an intersection of knowledge areas necessary to perform activities relevant for promoting assurance through claims argued and supported with evidence from `Software Security Engineering (SSE)` activities. SA entails SSE.
* This course takes on a software development lifecycle perspective for the prevention of flaws. It is not just secure coding!

# Class Format
* Asynchronous fully-online lectures, assignments, and exams
* Synchronous weekly team meetings at team determined times. Instructor check-ins will be required before the submission of major assignments. Multiple time-slots will be available to teams for flexibility in scheduling instructor check-ins.

# Where does the course fit in the degree program?
* [MS in Cybersecurity Core](https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-information-science-and-technology/school-of-interdisciplinary-informatics/cybersecurity/ms-cybr-reqs.php)

## Textbooks

Instead of a single textbook, I have identified a series of books available from the library as e-books. You will need to use NU VPN and authenticate with your user-id to access these books. Alternatively, you could use single sign-on using your `@unomaha.edu` email on safari books online.

# Engagement
While course content can be passively consumed, active participation in various class activities is important for your learning success. Here are some dimensions of [engagement](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/00346543074001059):

1. **Behavioral engagement**: attend and participate in class activities and discussions; follow class norms; study class materials and timely completion of assignments.
1. **Cognitive engagement**: desire a challenge; plan, monitor and evaluate one's thinking and learning (reflection).
2. **Emotional engagement**: comfortable talking to peers; engage in group learning where appropriate; ask questions about course material; interested, inquisitive and curious about academic content.

# Policy on Plagiarism
Any exam or assignment material submitted which looks identical in any fashion to another student's work or external sources will be considered plagiarism. I will adjust the grade to the minimum possible (Zero) for the assignment for all parties involved. Any further offenses will result in an “F” for the course, accompanied by academic dishonesty actions taken by the College Dean. Note carefully the University policy on [academic integrity](http://goo.gl/NVWUBy) and [code of conduct](https://www.unomaha.edu/student-life/student-conduct-and-community-standards/policies/code-of-conduct.php).  
Make yourself familiar with writing techniques such that you can cite external sources without plagiarizing. Here are a few links to writing resources: [[1]](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/using_research/quoting_paraphrasing_and_summarizing/index.html), [[2]](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/using_research/quoting_paraphrasing_and_summarizing/paraphrasing.html)

Many of your deliverables will be on Github in a public repository. As a result, you must be extra careful to avoid plagiarism through responsible and ethical practices.

# Exams
There will be a mid-term and a final exam. The exams will consist of essay-type questions which may require design and modeling activities. These exams will allow full access to technology and are intended to help focus on the essential parts of the course material, reinforce learning, and provide timely feedback. The exam questions will typically have multiple parts, be sure you answer all the parts.

# Team Working Sessions
Synchronous working sessions for teams will correspond to the stages of the software development lifecycle. The objective of these sessions is to gain hands-on experience with various techniques and tools for software assurance and apply them to understand the engineering activities necessary for building security in. Details about these sessions will follow as we go further into the semester.

# Team-based Semester Project
We will examine this aspect of the course in more detail next in this Module.

# Grading
20% Mid-term  
20% Final exam (Comprehensive)  
20% Quizzes, Discussions, and Class participation
