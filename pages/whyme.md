# Welcome to CYBR/CSCI 8420 Software Assurance

I am thrilled to have you in class this semester. Thank you for dedicating yourself to your academic journey in graduate school. You can do this!

## Why am I teaching this course?

I have researched, observed, and practiced software assurance activities in the software development lifecycle for over two decades. Software engineering is undergoing a major transformation with AI, adding uncertainty when making decisions about using code for organizational functions or critical operations. 

I bring my experience in this field to the design and delivery of this unique course at the intersection of Software Engineering, Cybersecurity and AI. This course has been offered every Fall at UNO since 2010 and has undergone continuous improvement. In 2020, I transitioned the course to an asynchronous format with significant emphasis on independent teamwork and open-source practices, similar to how many software engineering teams work today.

I am the Associate Dean for Research, Technology and Facilities and a Charles W. and Margre H. Durham Distinguished Professor of Cybersecurity. I received my Ph.D. in Information Technology from The University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

My research interests include:
- Secure software engineering
- Security requirements modeling and analysis
- Data preservation for scientific workflows
- System certification and accreditation

My work focuses on designing and assessing models that promote problem-solving for cybersecurity, bringing software security engineering to the forefront of US federal assessment and authorization processes for IT systems. I serve as a member of the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) board and as Associate Editor for the National Cyber Watch Cybersecurity Skills Journal (CSJ). I have worked with many influential people in this field and look forward to sharing my experiences with you.

My current research addresses a critical cybersecurity challenge facing smart infrastructure: using large amounts of data from sensing platforms to support decision-making. I am exploring the design problem of data trustworthiness in distributed processing environments, especially as we move toward edge-first AI, autonomous operations and digital twin applications. This work is highly relevant to the course's focus on software assurance and cybersecurity.
