# Class Topics*
Content will be linked as we progress through the semester. This allows to me to update/create/re-design content throughout the semester.

1. **The Demand for Software Assurance**
  * [Competencies](http://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=47953) and Sample [Job](https://robinagandhi.github.io/swa/resources/swa-positions-1.pdf) [Description](https://robinagandhi.github.io/swa/resources/swa-positions-2.pdf)
1. What is Software Assurance?
  * Reading: [Why hackers know more about our systems?](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/system-assurance/9780123814142/B9780123814142000014.xhtml)
1. **Collaborating when working on Software**
  - Self-paced module: Get familiar with version control.
1. **Engineering For Assurance**
  * Systems Security Engineering. Based on Chapter 2 from [NIST SP 800-160v1r1](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-160v1r1.pdf).
1. Engaging with Open Source Projects, by [Matt Germonprez](http://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-information-science-and-technology/about/faculty-staff/matt-germonprez.php)
1. **Requirements for Software Security Engineering**
  * The Meaning of Requirements for Software Security Engineering
  * Elicitation - Misuse Cases
  * Assignment: Misuse Case Exercise (Team Deliverable)
  * Reading: [Chapter 8, Software Security: Building Security In](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/software-security-building/0321356705/ch08.html)
  * Reading: [Misuse Cases](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1159030)
  * Additional Reference: Translating compliance constraints to requirements. [Page 262, NIST 800-160 public draft 2, Appendix-J](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-160/sp800_160_second-draft.pdf). This work is not available in the current revision, so we have to access it in prior versions of the document.
  * Hands-on: Working session on Misuse Cases
1. **Assurance Cases for Software Security Engineering**
  * Trustworthiness context: Assurance cases
  * Assignment: Assurance Case Exercise (Team Deliverable)
  * Reference: [ISO Standard](https://unomaha.on.worldcat.org/oclc/772089071?databaseList=638) for Assurance cases. (See Canvas for full-text)
  * Reference: [OMG Structured Assurance Case Metamodel](https://www.omg.org/spec/SACM/About-SACM)
  * Reference: Formal diagramming in [Adelard ASCE](https://www.adelard.com/asce/)
