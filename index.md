# Class Topics*
Content will be linked as we progress through the semester. This allows to me to update/create/re-design content throughout the semester.

1. **The Demand for Software Assurance**
  * [Competencies](http://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=47953) and Sample Job Description: [1](https://www.cisa.gov/careers/work-rolessecure-software-assessor), [2](https://robinagandhi.github.io/swa/resources/swa-positions-1.pdf), [3](https://robinagandhi.github.io/swa/resources/swa-positions-2.pdf)
1. What is Secure Software Development, Security and Operations (DevSecOps) Practices?
  * Reading: [NIST SP 1800-44A](https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/sites/default/files/2025-07/nist-sp-1800-44a-ipd.pdf), Companion [website](https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/projects/secure-software-development-security-and-operations-devsecops-practices)
1. **Collaborating when working on Software**
  - Self-paced module: Get familiar with version control.
1. **Engineering For Assurance**
  * Systems Security Engineering. Based on Chapter 2 from [NIST SP 800-160v1r1](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-160v1r1.pdf).
1. Engaging with Open Source Projects, by [Matt Germonprez](http://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-information-science-and-technology/about/faculty-staff/matt-germonprez.php)
1. **Requirements for Software Security Engineering**
  * The Meaning of Requirements for Software Security Engineering
  * Elicitation - Misuse Cases
  * Assignment: Misuse Case Exercise (Team Deliverable)
  * Reading: [Chapter 8, Software Security: Building Security In](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/software-security-building/0321356705/ch08.html)
  * Reading: [Misuse Cases](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1159030)
  * Additional Reference: Translating compliance constraints to requirements. [Page 262, NIST 800-160 public draft 2, Appendix-J](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-160/sp800_160_second-draft.pdf). This work is not available in the current revision, so we have to access it in prior versions of the document.
  * Hands-on: Working session on Misuse Cases
1. **Assurance Cases for Software Security Engineering**
  * Trustworthiness context: Assurance cases
  * Assignment: Assurance Case Exercise (Team Deliverable)
  * Reference: [ISO Standard](https://www.iso.org/standard/80625.html) for Assurance cases.
  * Reference: [OMG Structured Assurance Case Metamodel](https://www.omg.org/spec/SACM/About-SACM)
  * Reference: Formal diagramming in [Adelard ASCE](https://www.adelard.com/asce/)
1. **Maturity Models for Software Security Engineering**
  * Build Security In Maturity Model ([BSIMM](https://www.bsimm.com))<!-- -->
1. **Midterm Exam**
1. **Design for Software Security Engineering**
  * Lecture: Threat Modeling
  * Hands-on: Working session on Threat Modeling using Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool.  
<!-- * Lecture: Design patterns for Design Principles (Available only on Canvas) -->
<!-- * Lecture: Architectural patterns for security (Available only Canvas) -->
  * Reading: NIST 800-160v1r1, [Page 82, Appendix E. Principles for Trustworthy Secure Design](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-160v1r1.pdf)
1. **Coding for Software Security Engineering**
  * Lecture: Coding for SSE Lecture
  * Knowledge-bases: [Common Weakness Enumeration](http://cwe.mitre.org/), [CAPEC](https://capec.mitre.org/), [CERT Secure Coding Guidelines](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/SEI+CERT+Coding+Standards)
  * Tools: Security as Code in DevSecOps, eg. [CodeQL](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning-with-codeql), 
  [SpotBugs](https://spotbugs.github.io), [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org), [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/), [Visual Code Grepper](https://github.com/nccgroup/VCG), [AFL security-oriented fuzzer](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/), [Clang Static Analyzer](https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org), [Flawfinder](https://dwheeler.com/flawfinder/), [CWE compatible tools](https://cwe.mitre.org/compatible/category.html), [Tools curated by NIST](https://samate.nist.gov/index.php/Source_Code_Security_Analyzers.html), [Bytecode scanners](https://samate.nist.gov/index.php/Byte_Code_Scanners.html), [binary scanners](https://samate.nist.gov/index.php/Binary_Code_Scanners.html) and [language specific guidance](https://dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/language-specific.html). We will also explore the use of Large Language Models based Chatbots for code analysis. They are quite good at explaining code snippets and spotting potential software weaknesses. 
  * Lecture: Code review tools and techniques
  * Hands-on: Working session for code review and automated tool analysis.  
1. **Testing for Software Security Engineering**
1. **Project Presentations**
1. **Final Exam**
1. **Other topics**
  * Guest talks from other faculty or practitioners.
  * Quizzes at several checkpoints in the course.

\* These topics will get refined and updated as the semester progresses
